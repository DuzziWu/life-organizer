## Project Architecture

### Monorepo Structure
This is a monorepo with separate frontend and backend workspaces:
- `frontend/` - React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS
- `backend/` - Node.js + TypeScript + Express + Supabase integration
- Both workspaces are managed through the root package.json

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript and Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom futuristic Liquid Glass theme
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with React Context (âœ… IMPLEMENTED)
- **State Management**: React Context (auth) âœ…, Zustand (planned for widgets)
- **Routing**: React Router v6 with protected routes (âœ… IMPLEMENTED)
- **Drag & Drop**: HTML5 Drag & Drop API with custom implementation (âœ… IMPLEMENTED)
- **UI Components**: Custom Liquid Glass components âœ… + Radix UI primitives (planned)
- **Form Handling**: Custom forms with React state âœ… (React Hook Form + Zod planned)
- **Animation**: Custom CSS animations with Tailwind âœ…
- **Icons**: Lucide React âœ…

### Frontend Path Aliases (vite.config.ts)
```typescript
"@" -> "./src"
"@/components" -> "./src/components"  
"@/widgets" -> "./src/widgets"
"@/hooks" -> "./src/hooks"
"@/stores" -> "./src/stores"
"@/utils" -> "./src/utils"
"@/types" -> "./src/types"
```

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with TypeScript
- **Framework**: Express.js (planned)
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Real-time + Storage)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth
- **Development**: tsx for TypeScript execution with watch mode

### Widget System Architecture
The core concept is a flexible widget system where:
- Each widget follows a unified interface with type, position, size, and config
- **âœ… Drag & Drop**: Widgets are fully draggable with HTML5 API and intelligent collision detection
- **âœ… Grid Layout**: Fixed 135px grid cells with 9 columns and intelligent positioning
- **âœ… Size Management**: Support for Small (1Ã—1), Medium (1Ã—3), and Large (3Ã—3) widgets
- **âœ… Visual Feedback**: Live preview with cyan overlay and opacity changes during drag
- Widget state management will use Zustand stores
- Widget components are dynamically loaded based on type

### Tech Stack Highlights
- **Database**: Supabase for backend services (PostgreSQL, Auth, Real-time, Storage)
- **UI**: Custom futuristic theme with glass effects and cyber aesthetics
- **Form Validation**: Zod schemas for type-safe validation
- **Testing**: Vitest for unit testing, Testing Library for React components
- **Linting**: ESLint with TypeScript rules for both workspaces

**ðŸ“… PLANNED:**
- Calendar integration widget
- Email management widget
- Task/todo management widget

### Key Dependencies
- **Frontend**: React 18, React Router, Radix UI, Framer Motion, React Hook Form, Zod
- **Backend**: Express, Supabase client, bcryptjs, jsonwebtoken, winston
- **Development**: Vite, tsx, ESLint, Prettier, Vitest

## Supabase Configuration

### Database Connection
- **Project URL**: https://fzerbeehvifnusnjtmid.supabase.co
- **Environment**: Configured in `backend/.env` and `frontend/.env`
- **Email Confirmation**: Disabled for development (configured in Supabase dashboard)

### Current Schema
```sql
-- Key tables implemented:
profiles (id, user_id, full_name, avatar_url, created_at, updated_at)
dashboards (id, user_id, name, layout, created_at, updated_at)
widgets (id, type, name, description, default_config, created_at)
integrations (id, user_id, type, config, is_active, created_at, updated_at)
widget_data (id, user_id, widget_id, dashboard_id, position, size, config, created_at, updated_at)
```

## Authentication Flow

The app implements a complete German-localized authentication system:

1. **Login Page** (`/login`): Email/password login with Liquid Glass design
2. **Register Page** (`/register`): Account creation with full name
3. **First Visit** (`/first-visit`): Animated feature showcase with rocket launch
4. **Dashboard** (`/dashboard`): Protected main application area

### Key Components
- `AuthContext.tsx`: Main authentication context with Supabase integration
- `ProtectedRoute.tsx`: Route protection component
- `LiquidGlassCard.tsx`: Reusable UI component with glass morphism effect

## Drag & Drop System

### Widget Drag & Drop Implementation
The widget system features a complete HTML5 drag & drop implementation:

**Key Features:**
- **Drag Handle**: Move icon (ðŸ”€) appears on widget hover in top-left corner
- **Live Preview**: Cyan overlay shows valid drop positions in real-time
- **Collision Detection**: Prevents overlapping widgets with intelligent boundary checking
- **Grid Snapping**: Automatic alignment to 135px grid cells with 12px gaps
- **Visual Feedback**: Dragged widget becomes 50% transparent during operation

**Technical Implementation:**
```typescript
// Grid position calculation from mouse events
const getGridPositionFromMouseEvent = (e: DragEvent) => {
  const cellSize = 135, gap = 12
  const gridX = Math.floor(relativeX / (cellSize + gap))
  const gridY = Math.floor(relativeY / (cellSize + gap))
  return { x: gridX, y: gridY }
}

// Collision detection for widget placement
const canPlaceWidgetAt = (x, y, w, h, excludeId) => {
  // Check grid bounds and widget overlaps
  return !hasCollision && inBounds
}
```

**User Experience:**
1. Hover over widget â†’ Move handle appears
2. Drag handle â†’ Widget follows with live preview
3. Move over valid position â†’ Cyan preview shows placement
4. Drop â†’ Widget snaps to grid position
5. Database automatically updates with new position

### Animation System

### Rocket Launch Animation
The First-Visit page features a detailed rocket animation:
- Classic rocket design (red nose cone, white body, blue window)
- Smooth upward flight with scaling and opacity transitions
- Falling line background effects during launch
- 4-second animation duration with cubic-bezier easing

### Custom CSS Classes
```css
.animate-startup-rocket-launch - Main rocket flight animation
.animate-fall - Falling lines background effect
.glass-effect - Liquid glass morphism
.text-gradient - Cyber-themed text gradients
```

## Important Notes

- Always run commands from the root directory unless specifically working with a single workspace
- The project uses futuristic/cyber theming with custom CSS classes for glass effects and animations
- Supabase is the chosen backend solution for database, authentication, and real-time features
- The widget system is the core feature - widgets should be modular, draggable, and configurable
- Authentication is fully functional with German localization
- First-time users see an animated onboarding experience
